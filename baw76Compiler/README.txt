I had an issue with trying to lex my lexer. I got to a point where the lexer recognized all of my rules but would not run. It would just say "lex: fatal internal error, exec of /usr/bin/m4 failed". I could not figure why it would not execute and therefore could not properly test my driver. I even used -T to see how it constructed everything and nothing seemed to be wrong. I removed every individual line to see what caused it but nothing happened. Even when I removed all rules and just used literals, it gave me that error. I'm not sure if that's an issue with the lex itself or if something in my file was corrupted. Based off that, I was forced to code without being able to error check. If you could grade my project by inspection that would be greatly appreciated. I should have included all the required aspects of the project, it just doesn't run properly. I included the makefile. If you would want me to come into your office to show the issue I would be happy to as well just send me an email baw76@pitt.edu.

##Version 2: I have now fixed the errors. The error had something to do with Cygwin. I am not sure if it was my own error or not, but upon testing on Thoth, I was able to find and correct my errors. Either now I just get 10% off my grade, or I am currently speaking with the professor about getting some sort of forgiveness because of that error. Sorry for the trouble. 

To RUN: do "make driver"
